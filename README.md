Introduction

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for validating the shooting algorithm of a basketball robot. The robot utilizes a friction-based shooting mechanism instead of an articulated arm. The project aims to optimize trajectory tracking and control strategies to achieve accurate and consistent shots.
